# RPN
Reversed Polish Notation Calculator using stack
Hello I'm Daniel and it's my first "bigger" project and it not works the best but i have tried to build it on my own without any kind of help.
It is based on Qt and it was made with Qtcreator. It works fine on numbers from 0 to 99. It has 2 options one to simply count RPN value and 2 to show how it would look in infix(normal equation). It's made using stack and template. All of them are my own functions.
